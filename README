This color scheme is provided both light and dark version. I mainly do vim scripting and tex edditting, so these are supported in the best way (at least for now). Initially, it was based on rastafari colorscheme (#vimscript2198), but it looks much different.

You can get a grasp how it looks like:

http://www.math.ist.utl.pt/~mszamo/blue_sky_dark.jpg 

It provides one command:
:BlueSky
to change from night to day sky ;) and vice versa. You can also do that by hands: just set the variable:
let g:blue_sky_style = "light" or "dark"
and reload the colorscheme (this can be done in your vimrc file before ':colorscheme blue_sky' command).

Happy vimming :)
